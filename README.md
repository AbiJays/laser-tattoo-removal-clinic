Website for a Tattoo Removal Clinic based in Milton Keynes and London

**Favourite Feature:** Grid background structure where everything lines up to the large grey outline container. The visuals of this website are exquisite and I love my design choices for mobile. I also adore the layering on this site and the simplicity of features. 

**Greatest Challenge:** Designing the banners for each page while retaining the higher end visuals the client had requested, after many iterations I finally landed on what you can see in the video and in the end I am incredibly happy with what I created and cannot wait to see it in action.

**In an Ideal World:** I would have been able to see this website come to life and start resulting in some real work for the client but we will have to see.
